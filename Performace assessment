During my performance period, I successfully completed a **three-week Data Track training**, covering **Python, Data Engineering, Advanced Excel, Power BI, Databricks, and PySpark**. As a key achievement, I developed and presented a **“Macro2Micro Finance” dashboard** during a hackathon, demonstrating how **macroeconomic factors** like GDP affect **personal finance trends**.

Post-training, I joined the **HTI Innovation Pod**, contributing to the **Confluence Chatbot** project built using **RAG architecture** to enhance information retrieval from HSBC Confluence pages. I also **enrolled in the Design Pulse 2025 hackathon** to further enhance my innovation and problem-solving skills.

Through these experiences, I strengthened my technical expertise, analytical thinking, and collaborative skills while contributing to impactful, real-world projects.
