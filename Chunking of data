Perfect — this is a **core issue in RAG pipelines** using large Confluence data. You’re absolutely right: even if your URL search is optimal, **bad chunking ruins retrieval** (you end up embedding useless fragments or incomplete context).

Let’s design a **robust chunking strategy** specific to Confluence data — which can contain **tables, lists, headings, and prose** — and ensure that you maximize retrieval quality.

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Understand Your Data Structure

Confluence data is typically a mix of:

| Type            | Description                         | Example                                 |              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Headings**    | Logical sections (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) | “Setup Instructions”, “Troubleshooting” |              |
| **Paragraphs**  | Plain text or long explanations     | “To install X, follow these steps…”     |              |
| **Lists**       | Ordered/unordered lists             | “- Step 1”, “- Step 2”                  |              |
| **Tables**      | Key-value or reference data         | “Config                                 | Description” |
| **Code blocks** | Snippets or logs                    | “`kubectl apply -f …`”                  |              |

You should not treat all of them equally when chunking.

## 🧠 Step 2: The Ideal Chunking Strategy

We’ll combine **semantic chunking + structural chunking** for best results.

### ✅ **1. Use Heading-Based Chunking as Primary Boundary**

Split your document based on headings (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) first.
Each section under a heading becomes a logical chunk container.

Why:

* Headings represent **contextual boundaries**.
* Keeps related sentences together (unlike blind fixed-size chunking).

Example:

```
# Setup Guide
Step 1: Install dependencies
Step 2: Configure database

# Troubleshooting
If you get an error...
```

→ Two main chunks: `Setup Guide` and `Troubleshooting`.

---

### ✅ **2. Within Each Section, Apply Hybrid Chunking**

If sections are long, use **semantic or token-based chunking**:

| Approach           | Description                                         | Chunk size     | Ideal for                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Sentence-based** | Split by full stops and recombine up to ~500 tokens | 300–600 tokens | Text-heavy guides          |
| **Table-aware**    | Keep entire table as one chunk                      | N/A            | Config or comparison pages |
| **List-aware**     | Keep complete bullet list as one chunk              | N/A            | Step-by-step guides        |
| **Code-aware**     | Include code + explanation together                 | ≤ 400 tokens   | Setup examples             |

So if you have a section like:

```
### Deployment Steps
- Step 1: Create cluster
- Step 2: Deploy pods
```

→ Keep this list as a single chunk (don’t split between steps).

---

### ✅ **3. Use Overlaps to Preserve Context**

When chunking long text, use small **token overlap (50–100 tokens)**.

Helps when a concept flows across boundaries (e.g., “Step 3 continues from Step 2…”).

---

### ✅ **4. Represent Tables Properly Before Embedding**

If your data contains tables:

* Convert tables to **markdown text with key-value format** before embedding.
  Example:

  ```
  | Parameter | Description |
  |------------|-------------|
  | timeout | Time in seconds |
  ```

  → becomes

  ```
  Parameter: timeout  
  Description: Time in seconds
  ```
* This keeps it understandable for embeddings.

---

### ✅ **5. Store Metadata for Each Chunk**

While embedding, **attach metadata**:

```json
{
  "url": "https://confluence/.../setup",
  "title": "Setup Guide",
  "section": "Database Configuration",
  "chunk_index": 1,
  "content_type": "table"
}
```

This allows:

* Reranking by section relevance.
* Grouping results by URL during answer generation.

---

## ⚙️ Step 3: Implementation (Example in Python)

Here’s a high-level structure you can implement:

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    separators=["\n### ", "\n## ", "\n#", "\n\n", ". "],
    chunk_size=600,
    chunk_overlap=100,
    length_function=len,
    add_start_index=True
)

chunks = splitter.split_text(confluence_page_text)
```

Then, add logic to:

* Detect tables (`if '|' in line:` → treat as single chunk)
* Merge lists (`if line.startswith('- ') or line.startswith('* ')`)
* Embed each chunk with metadata.

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Optional — Use a Smart Semantic Splitter (Advanced)

You can replace token-based splitting with a **semantic segmenter**:

* Libraries like `semantic-text-splitter`, `spacy` or `textsplit` can group text by topic coherence.
* Example:

  ```python
  from semantic_text_splitter import TextSplitter
  splitter = TextSplitter(chunk_size=600)
  chunks = splitter.chunks(confluence_page_text)
  ```

  This prevents splitting mid-topic.

## ✅ Summary: Recommended Chunking Blueprint

| Rule                                                | Why                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Split by headings (`h1–h3`)                         | Maintain logical structure           |
| Merge lists, tables, and code blocks                | Preserve semantic meaning            |
| Limit chunks to ~500–600 tokens with 50–100 overlap | Optimal for embedding models         |
| Clean tables into text key-values                   | Improve readability for embeddings   |
| Store metadata (`url`, `section`, etc.)             | Enable better reranking and grouping |

If you tell me:

* how your current data is stored (HTML, Markdown, raw text, or JSON from API)
* and what embedding model you use (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)

…I can give you an **exact code-ready chunking pipeline** (with the right parsing and chunking logic).

Would you like me to build that next?
