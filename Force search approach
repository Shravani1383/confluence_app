distances, indices = index.search(query_vec, k=5)
scores = distances[0]

mean_score = np.mean(scores)

# Dynamic threshold rule
if max_score < 0.8 or (max_score - mean_score) < 0.05:
    # low confidence or all results are similar = probably noise

If all top results are close in score, it means the search couldn’t find anything sharply relevant (flat similarity curve).
If one score stands out strongly, it’s likely truly relevant.

Excellent — you’re now thinking about the **nuanced problem of partial matches** in RAG systems 👏

You’ve hit a very realistic challenge:

> Sometimes the retrieved context is *somewhat relevant* but *not enough* — it partially answers the query.
> In such cases, **blind fallback** may discard useful info, but **ignoring fallback** can lead to incomplete answers.

Let’s design a **smart hybrid approach** that can *detect “partial matches”* and handle them intelligently 👇

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: Categorize Match Quality

Instead of a binary “relevant or not,”
divide the results into **three zones** based on your computed match confidence and quality.

| Match Quality | Confidence | Meaning              | Action                  |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ≥ 0.75        | High       | ✅ Strong match       | Use RAG answer directly |
| 0.45–0.75     | Medium     | ⚠️ Partial relevance | Use + Fetch more        |
| < 0.45        | Low        | ❌ Irrelevant         | Trigger full fallback   |

This “middle zone” is key — that’s your **partial match** case.

---

## 🧠 Step 2: Hybrid Handling Strategy

```python
if match_quality >= 0.75:
    return rag_answer  # confident match
elif 0.45 <= match_quality < 0.75:
    # partial relevance
    extra_context = fetch_additional_data(query)
    merged_context = rag_answer + "\n\nAdditional context:\n" + extra_context
    return llm_answer(query, merged_context)
else:
    # poor match
    return fallback_fetch(query)
```

### Why it works:

* If your RAG gives **some** relevant chunks → you *don’t lose them*.
* You still enrich the response with **fresh / external info**.
* Avoids over-triggering fallbacks for small-but-useful matches.

---

## ⚙️ Step 3: Optional Heuristic for "Small Answers"

You can also detect **short RAG responses** — a strong signal that your retrieval wasn’t comprehensive enough.

Example:

```python
if len(rag_answer.split()) < 50 and match_quality < 0.8:
    # likely incomplete answer
    return hybrid_fetch(query)
```

That handles your “small but present” case directly.

---

## 🧩 Step 4: Combine Everything Into a Smart Controller

Here’s a clean version:

```python
def handle_rag_response(query, rag_answer, max_score, mean_score):
    confidence = (max_score - mean_score) / (1 - mean_score)
    match_quality = max_score * confidence

    if match_quality >= 0.75:
        return rag_answer, "strong"
    elif 0.45 <= match_quality < 0.75 or len(rag_answer.split()) < 50:
        extra_context = fetch_additional_data(query)
        merged_context = rag_answer + "\n\n(Additional Context):\n" + extra_context
        return llm_answer(query, merged_context), "partial"
    else:
        return fallback_fetch(query), "fallback"
```

---

## ✅ Result

* You **don’t lose partial info** from RAG.
* You **enrich weak answers** dynamically.
* You **avoid false fallbacks** when the retrieved context is actually useful.

---

Would you like me to show how to tune these thresholds dynamically based on your **historical FAISS query logs** (so they self-adjust over time)? That’s the next logical step for making it production-grade.
